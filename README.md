# Gmail-API-Email-Processor-Documentation
# Introduction:
This document provides an overview of the Gmail API email processor script, which is designed to fetch and process emails from a Gmail account. The script interacts with the Gmail API to retrieve emails, extract relevant information, and perform database operations based on the email content.

# Prerequisites:
Before using the script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

Gmail Account: You need access to a Gmail account from which emails will be processed.
Google API Credentials: Obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from the Google Cloud Console.
Database Configuration: Set up a MySQL database and configure the script with the appropriate database credentials.
# Components:
The script consists of the following components:

Database Module (db.py): Manages database connections and operations.
Thread Class (thread_class.py): Implements parallel HTTP request handling using multithreading.
Main Script (start.py): The primary script that interacts with the Gmail API, processes emails, and performs database operations.
# Flow:
The main script follows these steps:

Loading Environment Variables:
Loads necessary environment variables using the dotenv module.
Database Initialization:
Initializes a connection to the MySQL database using the SQLDatabase class from the db module.
Connects to the database using the provided credentials.
# Authentication:
Authenticates with the Gmail API using OAuth 2.0 credentials.
Handles token storage and refresh using the authenticate() function.
# Email Processing:
Fetches recent emails from the Gmail account using the list_messages() function.
Parses email headers, subject, and body content to extract relevant information.
Identifies sender and recipient information from email headers.
Processes the email body content to extract links and perform database operations based on the content.
Utilizes multithreading to fetch URLs in parallel for efficiency.
# Logging:
Logs script execution details and errors to a log file using the save_log() function.
Error Handling:
Handles exceptions and errors gracefully to prevent script termination.
Logs error messages for troubleshooting and analysis.
# Continuous Execution:
Runs in a continuous loop, periodically fetching and processing emails.
Sleeps for a specified interval between iterations to avoid excessive API requests.
#Conclusion:
The Gmail API email processor script offers a robust solution for automating email processing tasks. By leveraging the Gmail API, multithreading, and database integration, the script provides efficient and reliable email processing capabilities for various use cases.
